Conway's Game of Life in Ruby
=============================

This is a very simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life.  For information about GoL, visit the wikipedia page located here:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life

This game uses the colorize gem to display the cell color.

To start a new game, simply run cd into the directory, and run 'ruby game.rb' from the command line.

Enjoy!
